				<h1>Noltron000's Downtime Portfolio</h1>
				<h1>Test File</h1>
				<p>
					This webpage is dedicated to the projects which I work on during my downtime. Most of these projects are related to games, but <strong>not all</strong>. Some of my projects actually produce relevent and usable results, while others are merely experiences that aren't particularly useful for anyone <em>except me.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
					Since this website is somewhat lengthy, I suggest first looking at my Dice Roller page, which I set up specifically for the Holberton application.
				</p>


				<h2>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e</h2>
				<h3>Dice Roller</h3>
				<p>
					This project was created to try and impress Holberton (so I can get in!!). the internet really doesn't have many nice, clean interfaces for rolling dice, so I created one.
				</p>
				<h3>Enhanced Character Sheet</h3>
				<p>
					I love Dungeons and Dragons. I also love designing things. A thing I don't love is the original character sheets printouts for this game...So I made my own!
				</p>

				<h2>Getting a Job</h2>
				<h3>Professional Website</h3>
				<p>
					I have previously worked on getting a simple, single-page website up and running to help me get an internship for the Summer.
				</p>

				<h2>Building a Computer</h2>
				<h3>Mjolnir</h3>
				<p>
					Building a computer is a lot of fun, and reminds me of building with legos. You can make a wide variety of machines, from cheap to expensive, and set for different tasks.
				</p>

				<h2>Team Fortress 2</h2>
				<h3>Maximum Density CFG</h3>
				<p>
					Once I get into something, I take the time to get into the details tweak everything I can to optimize my experience and efficiency. Playing TF2 is no different. These cfg files are for my controls.
				</p>
				<h3>An Unusual Mod</h3>
				<p>
					A while back I played quite a bit of TF2. Some say it's a hat simulator, and some rarer hats have particle effects attached to them. I learned how to use the Source particle editor and upgraded the particle effects!
				</p>

				<h2>Velocibox</h2>
				<h3>Challange Experience</h3>
				<p>
					Velocibox is not necessarily a very complex game, but it is difficult. I love challenges, so I took the time to master the game and get a highscore on the leaderboard.
